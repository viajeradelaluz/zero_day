# 0x03. Git

This project is focused on learning what is source code management, Git and GitHub.

### Tasks names — Files — Description

- **0. Create and setup your Git and GitHub account** — ``README.md `` — You will need Git for this project, you might have to [install it](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/n2SJyaVuu1tuhVgHSKw5Sg) on your computer if it’s not done yet.

- **1. Repo-session** — ``zero_day `` — Create a new directory called `0x03-git` in your `zero_day` repo.

- **2. Coding fury road** — ``bash/best, bash/school, c/c_is_fun.c, js/main.js, js/index.js `` — For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a `README.md`. It’s time to code!

- **3. Collaboration is the base of a company** — ``bash/best, bash/school, bash/98`` — The purpose of a branch is to isolate your work from the main code base of your project and/or from your co-workers’ work.

- **4. Collaboration: be up to date** — ``README.md, up_to_date `` — For this task – **and only for this task** – please update your file `README.md` in the main branch from GitHub.com. It’s the **only time** you are allowed to update and commit from GitHub interface.

- **5. HAAA what did you do???** — ``0x03-git`` — To illustrate that, please merge the branch `update_script` to `main`: “Cool, all my changes will be now part of the main branch, ready to be deployed!”

- **6. Never push too much** — ``.gitignore`` — Create a `.gitignore` file and define a rule to never push `~` files (generated by Emacs). [Tips](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/0ANsyvhObT_TYAToY8-lbA).
